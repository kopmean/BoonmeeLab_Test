# BoonmeeLab Data Assignment: Thai Travel Thailand (TTT)

This repository contains the code and analysis for the data assignment provided by BoonmeeLab. The task involves analyzing user travel data from the Thai Travel Thailand (TTT) app to derive insights and answer specific business questions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to process and analyze travel data to answer the following questions:

1. What is the total number of trips?
2. How many provinces are there in the trip with the most number of provinces?
3. What are the most common province pairs that people travel to in the same trip?
4. How can we use the data to support our clientâ€™s business?

## Data

The input data consists of user travel logs with timestamps and locations. The output is a CSV file with trip details, including trip ID, user ID, start date, end date, and a list of provinces visited.

## Code

The code for this project is written in Python and is available in the Jupyter Notebook `Boonmee_DA_test.ipynb`.

### Dependencies
